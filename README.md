My homework for week 3:
I feel like it was a pleasantly challenging work and I do feel pretty good with my finished product.

The parts I did struggle with was first and foremost task number 3.
I did not entirely understand how I was suppose to work both action creators in to one module, and maybe I didn't quite understand that line perfectly. I will try to brush up on some terminology further on but I hope the way I made it isn't too far from what you were looking for.

There are a few things that I did feel like I had to *shoehorn* in to make it work, as with how I reset the guessed letters and how I incorporated the last three functionalities from the core logic file, these I might want to take a look at later on if I could have done it differently but other than that it was fun.
